    <p>The var() function in CSS is used to define and apply custom CSS variables, also known as CSS custom properties. CSS variables allow you to store and reuse values throughout your stylesheet. This can make your code more maintainable, as it allows you to change values in one place (the variable declaration) and have those changes reflected wherever the variable is used.</p>
