========================================================================
Ans. Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.

Que. 3) Define accessibility in the context of web development. Discuss why it's essential to create accessible website and how it      
        benefits different user groups.
====================================================================================================================================
Ans. Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can   
     use  them. More specifically, people can:
     perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
     contribute to the Web
     Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:
     auditory
     cognitive
     neurological
     physical
     speech
     visual
     Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example:
    people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.
    older people with changing abilities due to ageing

Que. 4) List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML.
==============================================================================
Ans. As you learn more about HTML — read more resources, look at more examples, etc. — you'll keep seeing a common theme: the importance of using semantic HTML (sometimes called POSH, or Plain Old Semantic HTML). This means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.

You might wonder why this is so important. After all, you can use a combination of CSS and JavaScript to make just about any HTML element behave in whatever way you want. For example, a control button to play a video on your site could be marked

Que. 5) Create a web page that highlights the features of HTML5. Use appropriate semantic tags to structure the content and showcase at 
        least three key features of HTML5 with explanations.
========================================================================================================================================

Creating a complete web page is beyond the scope of this text-based platform, but I can provide you with a simplified HTML5 code snippet that highlights three key features of HTML5 with explanations. You can use this as a starting point and expand upon it to create a full web page.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML5 Features</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to HTML5 Features</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Semantic Tags</h2>
        <p>HTML5 introduced semantic tags that provide better structure and meaning to web content. Some of the key semantic tags include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;header&gt;</code>: Defines a header for a section or a page.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>: Represents a navigation menu.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;article&gt;</code>: Represents a self-contained composition in a document.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>: Defines a footer for a section or a page.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Audio and Video Support</h2>
        <p>HTML5 provides native support for embedding audio and video content without the need for third-party plugins. You can use the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements to include multimedia in your web pages.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Local Storage</h2>
        <p>HTML5 introduced the <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> APIs, allowing web applications to store data locally on the user's device. This feature enables offline access and faster load times for web apps.</p>
    </section>

    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2023 HTML5 Features</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>

In this code:

The <header> element is used to define the page's header.
Two <section> elements are used to organize content into sections, each with a heading (<h2>) and an explanation of the HTML5 feature.
The first feature, "Semantic Tags," is explained, highlighting the importance of semantic tags like <header>, <nav>, <article>, and <footer>.
The second feature, "Audio and Video Support," is introduced, mentioning the <audio> and <video> elements.
The third feature, "Local Storage," is explained, mentioning the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs for storing data locally.
Finally, a <footer> element is used to define the page's footer.
You can enhance and style this code further to create a complete web page that showcases the features of HTML5.


Que. 6) Create a simple web page which has a table. The table must have 2 columns HTML and HTML5. The table should include a minimum of three rows describing the 
        difference between HTML and HTML 5.
==================================================================================================================================================================
Here's a simple HTML web page that includes a table with two columns, "HTML" and "HTML5," and provides a minimum of three rows describing the differences between HTML and HTML5:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML vs HTML5</title>
    <style>
        table {
            width: 80%;
            margin: 20px auto;
            border-collapse: collapse;
        }

        th, td {
            border: 1px solid #ddd;
            padding: 8px;
            text-align: left;
        }

        th {
            background-color: #f2f2f2;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Differences between HTML and HTML5</h1>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>HTML</th>
            <th>HTML5</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.</td>
            <td>HTML5 stands for HyperText Markup Language version 5.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>HTML4 was the previous version of HTML.</td>
            <td>HTML5 is the latest and current version of HTML.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>HTML4 had limited support for multimedia and interactive elements.</td>
            <td>HTML5 introduced native support for audio, video, and canvas elements, making it suitable for multimedia-rich web applications.</td>
        </tr>
       
    </table>
</body>
</html>

In this code:

We create a table with two columns using the <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td> HTML elements.
CSS is used to style the table, making it visually appealing.
Three rows are provided to describe key differences between HTML and HTML5. You can add more rows with additional differences if needed.
