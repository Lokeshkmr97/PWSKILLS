// Que. Explain the role of Operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming.?

/*
Operators in JavaScript are symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or more operands and produce a result. They are essential in programming for several reasons:

Performing Operations: Operators allow you to perform various operations, such as arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), assignment, comparison, logical operations, and more.

Manipulating Variables: Operators are crucial for manipulating variables and values.

String Concatenation: The + operator is not only used for addition but also for string concatenation. 

Increment and Decrement: The ++ (increment) and -- (decrement) operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1, respectively.
