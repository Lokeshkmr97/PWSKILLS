Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in javascript. Why is understanding these concepts important.

*/

/*
Precedence and associativity are two important concepts when it comes to understanding how multiple operators in an expression are evaluated. They dictate the order in which operations are performed and how expressions are parsed.

Precedence:
    Precedence determines the order of evaluation of operators. Higher precedence operators are evaluated first.
    For example, in the expression a + b * c, multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+). So, b * c is evaluated first, and then the result is added to a.

Associativity:
    Associativity determines the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated. It can be left-to-right or right-to-left.
    For example, the addition operator (+) is left-associative, meaning that if there are multiple additions in an expression, they are evaluated from left to right.
