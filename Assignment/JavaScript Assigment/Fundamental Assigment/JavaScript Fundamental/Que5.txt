Single-Line Comments:

Single-line comments start with // and extend to the end of the line. They are typically used for short comments or explanations on a single line.

// let total =0;

Multi-Line Comments:

Multi-line comments begin with /* and end with */. They can span multiple lines and are often used for more extensive explanations or comments that cover several lines of code.
